Final Hexen
Christopher Guerra

This engine is the proof of concept and not the final product for Final Hexen. A 2d JRPG, that uses 
elements of final fantasy and hexen put together. The assets such as sprites, tiles, and other images 
are not included due to copyright complications. This is purely academic.

Move up: 	w or Up_Arrow
Move Down: 	s or Down_Arrow

The Bad:
The code is somewhat in place for the UI elements, however
text currently is onoperable so displaying attack damage to monsters/health/leveling up is currently inoperable.

The Good:
Top Down world with roaming enemies and 2 dungeons via level transitions
Combat Screen w/2 Enemy types and seperate forms of data
2 Player classes with functioning level up capabilities
